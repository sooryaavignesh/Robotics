To animate a Robotic arm, throwing a glass tumbler using MATLAB.
 
The robot.key file is given as input to arm_animation.m file which then gives robot.ang file as its output.
Similarly, the object.key file is given as input to the cup_animation.m file which then give object.traj file as its output.

The robot.ang file is generated by doing Hermite interpolation technique for the robotic arm. 
The object.traj file is generated by doing SLERP for getting the rotation motion fo the object and Catmull-Rom for Positional interpolation of the object.
